# Example of iterating over two sequences as one

from itertools import chain
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = ['x', 'y', 'z']
for x in chain(a, b):
    print(x)
'''
chain() performs no such operation, so itâ€™s far
more efficient with memory if the input sequences are large
and it can be easily applied when the iterables in question
are of different types.
'''
c = [1, 2, 3, 4]
d = ('x', 'y', 'z')

for x in chain(d, c):
    print(x)
